Under the massive planetarium dome at the Swiss Museum of Transport, you will zoom into the infinite expanses of the universe, accompanied by improvisations. Sigurður Guðjónsson’s immersive 360-degree video Enigma also makes visible what is normally hidden from the human eye: with the help of an electron microscope, Guðjónsson scans the surface of a carbon fragment – suggestive images reminiscent of Martian landscapes. In tandem with the sounds of Anna Thorvaldsdottir, which oscillate subtly between flow and fragmentation, they combine to form a hypnotizing Gesamtkunstwerk.",2022-10-17 12:47:16.616272,

In György Ligeti’s case, a folksong-like melody runs through his work like an idée fixe. It appears, with touchingly transparent purity, in the second movement of his Violin Concerto. But it can also be found in other works, such as the early piano cycle Musica ricercata. Why did Ligeti return to this melody again and again? Does its fragile beauty point to biographical events, to experiences of war and the Holocaust, to which Ligeti’s family almost entirely fell victim? Patricia Kopatchinskaja explores these questions in a concert collage constructed around Ligeti’s Violin Concerto — including four world premieres that musically set out in search of Ligeti’s lost melody.",2022-10-17 12:47:18.225622,

The Festival begins in the planetarium at the Swiss Museum of Transport and, for this Late Night event, explores the sonic possibilities of the Neubad, a former public swimming pool. Musicians of the Lucerne Festival Contemporary Orchestra (LFCO) will transform the building into a spatial score, into a sequence of musical events, and even into an instrument. The journey leads through the entire Neubad to the central pool. Precisely notated scores, open playing instructions, and group improvisation guided by interactions with the audience will converge, linked by the “white noise” of everyday sounds, to create an expressive sonic journey towards silence.",2022-10-17 12:47:19.720118,

The musicians of the Lucerne Festival Contemporary Orchestra (LFCO) intertwine Gougalōn’s six movements with recent works that expand the traditional concept of concert performance with theatrical, experimental approaches, including two world premieres. And at the culmination of this event, “the whole village” gathers together for the collaborative project A Clean End, in which anyone can participate.",2022-10-17 12:47:22.656672,
